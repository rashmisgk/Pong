# Games
Hello, I'm Rashmi, and I want to share with you a game two games I've created. 
These games are a result of my participation in the CS50's 'Introduction to Game Development' course, where I learned valuable tutorials.

One of the games I've worked on is an updated version of the classic game Pong. 
While the original game required two players to play, I made some minor changes to create a single-player mode where you can challenge the computer. 
Now, you can enjoy Pong even when you don't have a friend around to play with.

To develop these games, I utilized LOVE2D, an excellent program that provides a robust environment for game development. 
I hope you have a great time playing them! Test your skills and see if you can outsmart the computer opponent in Pong!"

Feel free to customize it further if needed!
